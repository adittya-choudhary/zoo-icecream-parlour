MainParlour.java consists of the code with the menu initialized from the spec received, test ice cream orders and
 subsequently demonstrating their total results.
The calculator resides in Order.java class

Assumptions:
1. The calculator is written keeping in mind only the promo types provided in the spec.
The calculator takes into consideration the multiplier/quantifier variation of only the promos "Buy 2 Get 1 Free" & "Buy 2 Get 1 Half Price"
For example: Either it could be "Buy 3 Get 2 Free" or the multiples in the order qty.
